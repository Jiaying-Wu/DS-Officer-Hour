As the question you asked in the office hour, in order to caculate the row sum of some columns in a data frame, you can use the "rowwise()" function to compute on a data frame a row-at-a-time. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
df <- tibble(a = 1:3, b = 2:4, c = 3:5, d = 4:6)
df %>% 
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(sum_abc = sum(a, b, c))
```
